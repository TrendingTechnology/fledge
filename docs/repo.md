### Commit  
Commit files on your local repo
### Create dev branch  
Create a `dev` branch on your local repo

        git branch dev
        git checkout -b dev

### Push to remote  
Push your local repo to the remote repo.

        git push origin dev

### _Recommended_: Protect master branch  
On the repo server, it is recommended to set the `master` branch to protected and `dev` as the default branch. This is to prevent accidental manual pushes to the `master` branch.

After this point the remote `master` should be protected and should never be pushed-to manually. There should never be a reason to even checkout the local `master` branch locally. 

For example, see [https://help.github.com/articles/setting-the-default-branch](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-the-default-branch) and [https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-protected-branches](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-protected-branches).

All Fledge commands should only then be issued from
the local `dev` branch (Fledge will guarantee this).
